Memeism is the belief in the holy lord, Pepe. Pepe brings us our memes, water, and he is constantly in battle with the most evil being, the devil, Kazoo Kid.

C O M M A N D M E N T S

1. Always be memeulous.

2. Never mention 21 or what are those. These are classified as DEAD memes.

3. Swear obedience to the dankest, the coolest, the hippest: Lord Pepe.

4. Your mum is gay.

5. If you see a feminist, slaughter them.

If you stick by these, you will be rewarded with memez. African and black people will be given water, and condoms will be free (For all ages ;).

Our holy book is called Pleb. It shows memeists how to perfectly live their lives, making memes, and blowing up airports. (Whoops, that's the Quran.)

Memeism's teachings are as follows: do whatever you want, but make good memez.
