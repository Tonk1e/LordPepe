## What On Earth Is This Crap?
This is Lord Pepe. He is a Discord bot. He has a few commands that may be interesting to some of you, and has some ok features. He is   able to stream audio from YouTube. No, you don't have to provide a link, just do `$play NAME_OF_WHATEVER`. This bot is in no way        professional, as I am just a kid. But, if you are interested for some reason that I can't think of, then hit me up fam.

## How Do I Use Him?
I don't see why you'd want to, but if you really want to then here you go.

### Add Him To Your Server.

### Commands
